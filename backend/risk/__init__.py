"""Hybrid risk engine: unified account/transaction risk scoring.

The engine fuses three independent signal families into a single 0-100
composite score with a SAFE / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL taxonomy:

  * deterministic rules       — behavioural transaction rules + account
                                fraud_heat (fusion layer),
  * ML ensemble               — IsolationForest, LOF, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN,
                                One-Class SVM, PCA reconstruction error, and
                                (when ground truth is available) supervised
                                RandomForest / XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost,
  * graph analytics           — PageRank / degree / betweenness / community
                                features plus Node2Vec embedding signals
                                over the account money-flow network.

On top of the composite sits the **Hybrid Multi-Stage Fraud Detection
Engine** (`hybrid.py`): behavioural profiling, temporal sliding windows,
telecom/internet correlation, money-flow N-hop analysis, unified entity
risk, named scenario detection and per-decision explainability — fused
through configurable weights (`weights.py`).
